Description
---
First, programm creates a sphere in three-dimensional space, for this we set a multidimensional list with a linear
relationship and constraints from 0 to 2 pi and from 1.1 pi to pi divided by three, all this is needed to create the shape
of the cup, for a better representation of the beauty of the golden ratio.

x, y and z are given by the following formulas:

$`
x = sin(phi) cos(theta),
`$
$`
y = sin(phi) sin(theta),
`$
$`
z = cos(phi)
`$

whrere phi and theta are given by the following:

theta, phi = [0:2*pi:100],[1.1*pi:pi/3:100]
radius in this case will be equal to one.

limitation of the list from 0 to two pi is made due to the fact that the measurement system is made in radians,
and also limitation of theta from 1.1 pi to pi/3 is obtained to create a cup effect.

To make radius and teta angle values need to use this formulas

$`r=aphi^{2teta/pi}`$

where phi is golden ration, and a is arbitrary positive real constant


line_theta = np.linspace(0, pi, n+1)
line_phi = np.linspace(pi, pi/2, n+1)

Values for the sphere envelope line


Change coordinates due to line
$`
line_y = sin(line_phi)sin(teta)r
`$
$`
line_z = sin(line_phi)cos(teta)r
`$

$`
line_x = sqrt{1-line_y^2-line_z^2}
`$
