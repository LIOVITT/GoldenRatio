Description
---
First, programm creates a sphere in three-dimensional space, for this we set a multidimensional list with a linear
relationship and constraints from 0 to 2 pi and from 1.1 pi to pi divided by three, all this is needed to create the shape
of the cup, for a better representation of the beauty of the golden ratio.

x, y and z are given by the following formulas:

x = np.sin(phi) * np.cos(theta)
y = np.sin(phi) * np.sin(theta)
z = np.cos(phi)

whrere phi and theta are given by the following:

theta, phi = [0:2*pi:100],[1.1*pi:pi/3:100]
radius in this case will be equal to one.

limitation of the list from 0 to two pi is made due to the fact that the measurement system is made in radians,
and also limitation of theta from 1.1 pi to pi/3 is obtained to create a cup effect.

To make radius and teta angle values need to use this formulas

$`r=a*phi^(2*teta/pi)`$



where phi is golden ration, and a is arbitrary positive real constant
