Math description
---
First, the program creates a sphere in three-dimensional space, for this we set a multidimensional list with a linear
relationship and constraints from 0 to 2 $\pi$ and from 1.1 $\pi$ to $\pi$ divided by three, all this is needed to create the shape
of the cup, for a better representation of the beauty of the golden ratio.

$x$, $y$ and $z$ are given by the following formulas:

$x = sin(\phi) cos(\theta),$

$y = sin(\phi) sin(\theta), $

$z = cos(\phi)$

where $\phi$ and $\theta$ are run in the ranges:

$\theta \in [0, 2\pi]$

$\phi \in [1.1 \pi,\pi/3]$

radius in this case will be equal to one.

The limitation of the list from 0 to $2\pi$ is made due to the fact that the measurement system is made in radians,
and also limitation of theta from 1.1 $\pi$ to $\pi/3$ is obtained to create a cup effect.

To make radius and theta angle values need to use this formulas

$r=a\Phi^{2\theta/\pi}$,

where $\Phi$ is golden ration, 
and $a$ is arbitrary positive real constant

$\phi_{line} \in [\pi, \pi/2]$

Value for the sphere envelope line


Change coordinates due to line

$y_{line} = sin(\phi_{line})sin(\theta)r$

$z_{line} = sin(\phi_{line})cos(\theta)r$

$x_{line} = \sqrt{1-y_{line}^2-z_{line}^2}$


Changes $x$, $y$, and $z$ values to sphere coordinates

$\alpha = (\pi/(n_d/2))i$
where $`n_d`$ is 12 - values of spirals

$x_{line_{d}} = cos(\alpha)x_{line} - sin(\alpha)y_{line}$

$y_{line_{d}} = sin(\alpha)x_{line} + cos(\alpha)y_{line}$

$z_{line_{d}} = z_{line}$
