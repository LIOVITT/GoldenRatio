First, programmatically creates a sphere in three-dimensional space, for this we set a multidimensional list with a linear
relationship and constraints from 0 to 2 pi and from 1.1 pi to pi divided by three, all this is needed to create the shape
of the cup, for a better representation of the beauty of the golden ratio.

$p_u = i^4$
